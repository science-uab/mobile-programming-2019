A basic Chat application implemented using React Native for Client-side and NodeJs on Server-side. 
Every message sent by the user is scored using the Sentiment library by tokenizing the message string.

The WEBSOCKET protocol is used to pass the messages stack from React state to the server and finally to the other clients connected.
